Companies produce vast amounts of sales data for various items, places, and time periods. However, it becomes challenging to determine which goods are generating income, recognize seasonal trends, and comprehend consumer purchase behavior in the absence of comprehensive analysis. Missed opportunities, ineffective inventory management, and poor decision-making can result from this lack of understanding. By looking at product categories, sales volumes, and revenue patterns, this research seeks to assess sales success. The study will enable data-driven initiatives to boost business development, optimize product offerings, and improve decision-making by identifying trends and key drivers of sales.
